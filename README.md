## Lazy Indoor Garden

# Introduction 
A small garden located within an apartment, where the temperature, water level, and light are adjusted according to the type of plants in the garden. The temperature, humidity, and light levels will be monitored using sensors placed in the garden. The measured parameters will be displayed on an LCD.

# Descriprion
The input part of the project consists of using multiple sensors that read, at well-defined time intervals, the environmental parameters specified in the previous section, thereby providing control data for the automated system.

Thus, detecting a temperature above the allowable limits triggers the activation of a fan to partially reduce the excessive heat, which could harm the plant. Additionally, an LED system is used for ambient lighting in the flower nursery, which can be activated on cloudy days, at dusk, or by any other factor that reduces the amount of natural or artificial light received.
